# EPGExport

EPGExport is a plugin for Enigma2 based devices will allow the export of the EPG system to an XMLTV file.

This code was originally developed by [Gutemine](https://sourceforge.net/u/gutemine/profile).  I cannot seem to find the source anywhere except in a package manager [here](https://gemfury.com/gutemine-feed/deb:enigma2-plugin-extensions-epgexport/-/content/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/EPGExport).  This code is based off of version 1 RC3.

An early version can be found [here](https://www.linuxsat-support.com/filebase/file/344-epgexport-plugin/), with more details, but the above URL appears to be a later version of the plugin.

## Installation

Download the IPK to a folder on your Enigma2 box, and then go the "System > Software Management > Install Local Extension".  Find the IPK downloaded to the box, and install.  Once installed, reboot the GUI for the box.

## Usage

Go to "Plugins > EPGExport" and configure.  Then select "Downloading" and this will produce your XMLTV file
